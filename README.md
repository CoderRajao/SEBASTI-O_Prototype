The objective of this project:
THIS PROJECT IS A PROTOTYPE, that means it's NOT
FINISHED. The main goal was to make a more interactive 
chatbot inspired by J.A.R.V.I.S. All of the main features are
working, but the Ai sometimes misinterprets your feeling. Im looking
to make SEBASTIAO a better interface then just prints.

The project in its corrent state is fun to mess
around with.
